## Step 1: Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a project" or "Add project"
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "portfolio-app")
4. Choose whether to enable Google Analytics (optional)
5. Click "Create project"

## Step 2: Enable Firestore Database

1. In your Firebase project, go to "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in test mode" for development (you can secure it later)
4. Select a location for your database
5. Click "Done"

## Step 3: Get Firebase Configuration

1. In your Firebase project, click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) next to "Project Overview"
2. Select "Project settings"
3. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
4. Click the web icon (</>)
5. Register your app with a nickname (e.g., "portfolio-web")
6. Copy the Firebase configuration object

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `firebase-config.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in your Firebase configuration values:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com

}
```

## Step 7: Security Rules (Optional)

For production, consider adding security rules to your Firestore database:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read access to all documents
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false; // Only allow writes from Firebase Console
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 8: Test Your Application

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to your portfolio pages
3. Check the browser console for any Firebase connection errors
4. Verify that data is loading from Firebase

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Firebase App named '[DEFAULT]' already exists"**
   - This usually means Firebase is being initialized multiple times
   - Check that you're only importing the Firebase config once

2. **"Missing or insufficient permissions"**
   - Ensure your Firestore security rules allow read access
   - Check that your Firebase config is correct

3. **Data not loading**
   - Verify your collection names match exactly
   - Check that documents have the correct field names
   - Ensure your environment variables are loaded

### Debug Tips:

- Use Firebase Console to verify your data structure
- Check browser console for error messages
- Use `console.log()` to debug data fetching
- Verify environment variables are loaded correctly

## Next Steps

- Customize the data structure to match your needs
- Add more collections for additional content
- Implement caching strategies for better performance
- Set up Firebase Analytics to track usage
- Consider implementing user authentication for admin features

## Resume PDF Integration

To enable the resume download functionality:

1. **Upload your resume PDF to Firebase Storage**:
   - Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Storage
   - Create a new bucket if needed
   - Upload your resume PDF file
   - Make it publicly accessible

2. **Update the download function** in `app/about/page.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const handleDownloadResume = async () => {
     try {
       const response = await fetch('YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_URL/resume.pdf')
       const blob = await response.blob()
       const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob)
       const a = document.createElement('a')
       a.href = url
       a.download = 'Arpit_Goyal_Resume.pdf'
       document.body.appendChild(a)
       a.click()
       window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url)
       document.body.removeChild(a)
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error downloading resume:', error)
       alert('Failed to download resume. Please try again.')
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Alternative**: Host your PDF on a CDN or cloud storage service and update the download URL directly.

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the [Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs)
2. Review the [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
3. Check the browser console for error messages
4. Verify your Firebase configuration and data structure

## Skills Collection

Create a collection called `skills` with the following document structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Python",
  "category": "Programming Languages",
  "proficiency": 90,
  "icon": "py",
  "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Icon Field Values

The `icon` field should use the skill identifiers from [skill-icons.dev](https://skillicons.dev). Here are some common examples:

- **Programming Languages**: `py` (Python), `js` (JavaScript), `ts` (TypeScript), `java`, `cpp`, `csharp`, `go`, `rust`, `php`, `ruby`, `swift`, `kotlin`
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: `react`, `vue`, `angular`, `django`, `flask`, `spring`, `express`, `laravel`, `rails`, `nextjs`, `nuxtjs`
- **Databases**: `mysql`, `postgresql`, `mongodb`, `redis`, `sqlite`, `oracle`, `sqlserver`
- **Cloud & DevOps**: `aws`, `azure`, `gcp`, `docker`, `kubernetes`, `terraform`, `jenkins`, `gitlab`, `github`
- **Tools & IDEs**: `vscode`, `intellij`, `eclipse`, `vim`, `git`, `postman`, `figma`, `photoshop`
- **Operating Systems**: `linux`, `windows`, `macos`, `ubuntu`, `centos`, `debian`

### Sample Skills Documents

```json
// Python
{
  "name": "Python",
  "category": "Programming Languages",
  "proficiency": 90,
  "icon": "py",
  "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}

// Django
{
  "name": "Django",
  "category": "Web Frameworks",
  "proficiency": 85,
  "icon": "django",
  "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}

// React
{
  "name": "React",
  "category": "Frontend Frameworks",
  "proficiency": 80,
  "icon": "react",
  "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}

// PostgreSQL
{
  "name": "PostgreSQL",
  "category": "Databases",
  "proficiency": 75,
  "icon": "postgresql",
  "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}

// Docker
{
  "name": "Docker",
  "category": "DevOps",
  "proficiency": 70,
  "icon": "docker",
  "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### How It Works

The application automatically generates skill icon URLs using the format:
```
https://skillicons.dev/icons?i={icon}
```

For example:
- `icon: "py"` ‚Üí `https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py`
- `icon: "react"` ‚Üí `https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react`
- `icon: "django"` ‚Üí `https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=django`

This provides professional, consistent skill icons that automatically match your skill names and look great on your portfolio!
